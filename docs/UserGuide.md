## Program Management
The `program` command not only allows you to assign a workout to a given day, but it allows you to log your completed exercises.

### Choose a workout plan for a day
You may assign a workout plan to a specific day of the week using the `/assign` flag.
```
program /assign <WORKOUT_PLAN_NAME [string]> /to <DAY [string]>
```

The `<DAY [string]>` parameter must be either variants of a day of the week, and is case insensitive:

3. Wednesday / Wed
4. Thursday / Thurs / Thu
5. Friday / Fri
6. Saturday / Sat

	MONDAY: 	full body
		1. benchpress
		2. barbell squat
		3. deadlift

	TUESDAY: Rest day

	WEDNESDAY: 	legs

```
program /clear <DAY [string]>
```
As stated, the DAY parameter must follow the format above.

Example of usage: 
```

```
[BYTE-CEPS]> All your workouts have been cleared from the week
```

## Logging Workouts
You can log the amount of weight, sets, and repetitions you have completed for an exercise on a given day using the logging functionality. This allows for comprehensive tracking of your workout progress over time.

To log your exercises, you must first have a workout plan assigned for the day you are logging. It's possible to log an exercise not originally in your workout plan, providing flexibility in your programs. However, the exercise must be created beforehand.

### Adding an exercise log
You may create a workout log using the `/log` flag in the program command. Now, with enhanced functionality, you can log multiple weights and repetitions for each set, allowing for a more detailed recording of your workout.

#### To log a single set of an exercise
```
program /log <EXERCISE_NAME [string]> /weight <WEIGHT [integer]> /sets <NUMBER_OF_SETS [integer]> /reps <NUMBER_OF_REPS [integer]>
```

Example of usage: 
```
program /log benchpress /weight 125 /sets 1 /reps 5
```

Expected outcome:
```
[BYTE-CEPS]> Successfully logged benchpress with a weight of 125kg and 5 reps across 1 set on 2024-03-28
```

#### Logging Multiple Sets with Varying Weights and Reps
```
program /log <EXERCISE_NAME [string]> /weight <WEIGHT1 [integer] WEIGHT2 [integer] ...> /sets <NUMBER_OF_SETS> /reps <REPS1 [integer] REPS2 [integer] ...>
```

Example of usage: 
```
program /log benchpress /weight 100 110 120 /sets 3 /reps 5 4 3
```

Expected outcome:
```
[BYTE-CEPS]> Successfully logged benchpress with weights of 100kg, 110kg, 120kg and reps of 5, 4, 3 across 3 sets on 2024-03-28
```

#### Overwriting a Existing Log
You may overwrite an existing logged exercise by logging an exercise with the same name.

For example, you may have logged an exercise incorrectly.
```
program /log benchpress /weight 100 11 120 /sets 3 /reps 5 4 3
```

You may wish to overwrite it by sending the same command with the fixed values.
```
program /log benchpress /weight 100 110 120 /sets 3 /reps 5 4 3
```

Expected outcome:
```
[BYTE-CEPS]> It seems like benchpress already exists, overwriting...
[BYTE-CEPS]> Successfully logged benchpress with weights of 100kg, 110kg, 120kg and 5, 4, 3 reps across 3 sets on 2024-04-14
```


### Adding an exercise log for a separate date
You may also create a workout log for a specified date.
```
program /log <EXERCISE_NAME [string]> /weight <WEIGHT [integer]> /sets <NUMBER_OF_SETS [integer]> /reps <NUMBER_OF_REPS [integer]> /date <DATE [yyyy-mm-dd]>
```

Example of usage: 
```
program /log benchpress /weight 125 /sets 1 /reps 5 /date 2024-03-25
```

Expected outcome:
```
[BYTE-CEPS]> Successfully logged 125kg benchpress with 3 sets and 5 reps on 2024-03-25
```

### Viewing logs
You may see all the dates that you have entered at least a log entry by using the `/history` flag in the program command. 
```
program /history
```

Example of usage:
```
program /history
```

Expected outcome:
```
[BYTE-CEPS]> Listing Workout Logs:
			1. 2024-03-27
			2. 2024-03-06
			3. 2024-03-28
			4. 2024-03-25
```

### Viewing historic logs
You may view the logs that you have added on a given date by specifying a date in the `/history` flag.
```
program /history <DATE [yyyy-mm-dd]>
```

Example of usage:
```
program /history 2024-03-27
```

Expected outcome:
```
[BYTE-CEPS]> Listing Exercises on 2024-03-27:
			1. barbell squat (weight: 70, sets: 3, reps: 5)
			2. leg extensions (weight: 55, sets: 3, reps: 15)
```
## Help Menu
You are able to access an in-program help menu that provides you with command formats for all of ByteCeps's functionality.

### Accessing Help Menu
ByteCeps provides the command format to access the help menu upon initial program execution:
```
[BYTE-CEPS]> To access the help menu for command guidance, please type:
help /COMMAND_TYPE_FLAG
Available command types (type exactly as shown):

To view this message that provides guidance for how to access the help menu, a user only needs to type `help` with no additional flags or parameters.

Command formats are shown according to 3 separate categories: `exercise`, `workout` & `program`

### Displaying Help Menu Category: Exercise
You may access this portion of the help menu using the `/exercise` flag with the `help command`:

			 1. add an exercise
			 2. delete an existing exercise
			 3. edit an existing exercise's name
			 4. list all existing exercises
```

To see a specific `exercise`-related command's format, enter `help /exercise <INDEX [integer]>`.

The `<INDEX [integer]>` parameter refers to the desired command's corresponding list number as displayed by the help menu.

## Exiting program
You may exit the program using the `exit` command.
```

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------
GOODBYE FOR NOW. STAY HARD!
-------------------------------------------------
```

## Saving the data
BYTE-CEPS data are saved in the hard disk automatically after the `exit` command . There is no need to save manually.

## Editing the data
BYTE-CEPS data are saved automatically as a JSON file `data.json` in the same directory as the Jar File. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

> Caution: If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, BYTE-CEPS will save the current data file as `data.json.old_YYYY_MMDD_HHSS_MM` and start with an empty data file at the next run.
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the BYTE-CEPS to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a date entered is of a different format). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
